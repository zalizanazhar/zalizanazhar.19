## Hello, new student!

![](docs/images/week01/assignment-photo.jpg){: width="100%"}

## Welcome to your new EP1000 website

This is an example student blog for the EP1000 DFab module.

## How to edit it

You can edit it on [GitHub](http://github.com). The software used turns simple text files
written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, into the site you are navigating.

No worries, you can't break anything, all the changes you make are saved under [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) using [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). This means that you have all the different versions of your page saved and available all the time in the Gitlab interface.

## In short

- This website is built automatically by github every time you edit the files in the docs folder
- It does so thanks to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generator written in Ruby
- You must start customizing the file `_config.yml` with your information
- You can change the looks of your website using jekyll themes, you can find in the `_config.yml` the options for the [panthera-jekyll theme](https://github.com/christianezeani/panthera-jekyll)
- If you want to start from scratch, you can delete everything (using [git-rm](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm)) in this repository and push any other static website
